I am a twenty year veteran of the United States Navy. My occupations during my service were as a Bosn's Mate, Cryptographic Technician (Communications) and as a Information Systems Technician. I was assigned to commands in Hawaii, Washington, DC and Norfolk, Virginia. I also deployed to Diego Garcia, BIOT; the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea.
